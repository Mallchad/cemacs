#+Title: Plan
* Overview
* Priority
** TODO [#A] Get read for next stable update
Lot's of the config has been updated and much of it has been used for quite a
while now and is becoming reasonable stable.

Before merging to master some loose ends should be tied up, removing unnecessary
comments, completing documentation, switching out some variables for functions,
renaming symbols to something better.

The cherry on top would be making the config a little less rigid in the way it is
written.

** TODO [#B] Add a more detailed description to this document
Self explanatory.

** TODO [#B] Fix annoying smartparens
The current smartparens behaviour won't balance sexp when you insert a new pair,
ie if you already have an unmatched brace ~)~ and type ~(~ to the left of that sexp,
it will insert ~()~ instead if realizing that the sexp is already balanced out.

** TODO [#B] Fix undo tree randomly exiting when reaching a branch root

** TODO Create a system to open up a bunch of files when one of them is visited
The point of this is to open up many files in one go when you visit files in a
user-specified file "group".

The motivation behind such a mechanism is to improve the usage of files that are
compressed, encrypted, or are just generally large files.
In all of the above cases it is extremely tedious to open all the files manually,
especially considering cases where emacs will block the entire application whilst
it opens, every, single, individual, file.
This could be made asynchronously if the operation is done in bulk.

This could be as simple as hooking onto or modifying the ~file-file~ function and
checking the requested file to open against the file groups.
This system should replace the horrifically rigid org mode setup they opens all
files in the directory =~/org=

** Unbind ~overwrite-mode~ by deafult
overwrite mode has almost no benefits and can be easily replaced with deleting
or killing text before typing.
Yet at the same time it is extremely annoying when you start typing not realizing
you accidentally hit that one exact insert key on the keyboard.

* Backburner
** TODO Add yasippet for fast boilerplate code and text
In the future this could be tied in with a future project
"boilermancer" is the current name for the project, a project which
creates templates for boilerplate code.

** TODO Create a custom function to clean up or adopt deprecated files/directories
This is a way to periodically clean up files that are not necessary or
no longer adhere to the new custom locations specified by this config
file.

** TODO Make a reverse pop to mark command
pop-to-mark command is great but it's far too common to shoot past the
desired location, and then you want to head back up the marker stack,
but you can't

** TODO Make helm swoop drop a mark
This is actually used surprisingly often and having it drop the make
would make pop-to-mark-command way more useful.

** TODO Make an org-mode binding to set TODO to DONE and archive tag in one go
** TODO Mode all org-mode related functions to the req-package macro
** TODO Make the config more configurable so other people can use it
** TODO Create a high-performance mode that disables many unnecessary functions
** TODO Create a close-to-vanilla emacs setup, similar to ergomacs
** TODO Globally enable and change the colour of the visible mark
